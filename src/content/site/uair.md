		<a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uair#Scottish_Gaelic'>Uair</a> is the working title of the game framework that I've been working on for longer than 
	I'd ever admit. It's gone through many incarnations (I even <a href='game-off-2012.html'>ported one version over to javascript</a>) but has always been written 
	C++ using OpenGL for rendering. The current version uses C++11 and OpenGL 3.3 and is nearing a useable stage.

		The purpose of this project is to both give me a platform I am comfortable with in any future projects I might undertake, and as an educational tool so that 
	I can better understand the lower level workings of such a framework (I feel using one of the existing great game engines out there would obscure some of the 
	stuff under the hood which I would really like to learn). It is licensed under the <a href='http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Zlib'>zlib</a> licence so that 
	others might be able to learn from it too.
