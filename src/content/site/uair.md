		<a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uair#Scottish_Gaelic'>Uair</a> is the
		working title of a game framework that I've been developing on and off for a
		while as a means to learn and experiment with different technologies and techniques.
		It is available under the permissive <a href='https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib'>Zlib licence</a>
		so have at it.
